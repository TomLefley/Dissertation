\caption{The time in seconds by each pipeline stage when fracturing the Stanford Bunny, consisting of 69,666 triangles, over 10 runs using DVF. The number of generated fragments can vary slightly, resulting in the number of times the marching tetrahedra and instantiation phases are applied differing between runs.}
