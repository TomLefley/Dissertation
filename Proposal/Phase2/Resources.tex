I will be working with a free license of Unity3D installed on my own computer with the following specifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item 3.40GHz i5-4670k
\item 8GB RAM
\item 400GB remaining SSD storage
\item 750GB remaining HDD storage
\item AMD Radeon HD 7950 GPU
	\begin{itemize}
	\item 3GB GDDR5 Memory
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

I accept full responsibility for this machine and I have made contingency plans to protect myself against hardware and/or software failure.

All source code will be be backed up and version controlled using Git with GitHub. Documentation, as well as any further resources, will be created and stored in a Microsoft OneDrive cloud folder with regular backups to Google Drive as well as my own hard disk drive.
